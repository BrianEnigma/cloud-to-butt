This Variant
------------

This project is a fork of the original.  The main change here is that certain input.text and textarea fields of the Trac bug tracking system are **not** traversed into.  Letting this extension search-and-replace those fields leads to hilarious and embarrassing results any time you edit *any* field of the bug.  While those results *are* hilarious, it's best for everyone if we just avoid that situation.
